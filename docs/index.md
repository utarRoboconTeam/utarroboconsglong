Hey there! We are UTAR ROBOCON Team from Sg Long Campus.

This website serves as a documentation and tutorials for new members and committees who would like to have a proper documentation on how to run the team, construct robots, discover new technology to be used in ROBOCON competitions and many more.

Just a small note that the activeness of this website's content updates is subjected to the committees' contribution (and availability ofc). If you notice that no more content updates from this website, most likely the team is still active but has moved on from this website.

"Send them home." -UTAR ROBOCON Team
