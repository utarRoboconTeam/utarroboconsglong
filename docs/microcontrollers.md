title: How to Choose Microcontrollers for ROBOCON?
parent: Home
---

You have microcontrollers from Arduino, Espressif, STM32 and many more, how should you choose them?

It all comes down to:
1) Number of I/O pins
2) Flash memory size
3) SRAM size
4) Logic voltage level
5) The processing speed

Here in UTAR ROBOCON Team, most of the microcontrollers (or development boards) used are the original ESP32 boards, specifically ESP32 DOIT DevKit V1. They are great for wireless control of robots thanks to Espressif's ESP-NOW wireless protocol.

Now there will be a migration from the original ESP32 DOIT DevKit V1 to ESP32-S3 boards. The advantages and disadvantages of doing so are listed in the table below:

| ESP32 DOIT DevKit V1 | Aspects | ESP32-S3 |
|:---------------------|:--------|:---------|
| LX6                  |Processor| LX7      |
