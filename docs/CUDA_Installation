How to install and activate your laptop or computer's CUDA? (Assuming you have an NVIDIA GPU that supports CUDA)

1) Download the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit from this website, select your machine specs and follow its installation instructions carefully
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=deb_local

2) Restart your laptop (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)

3) Open up the terminal or command prompt, type
```nvidia-smi```

This should display some information about your NVIDIA GPU, if the nvidia-smi is successfully activated as shown in the screenshot below
